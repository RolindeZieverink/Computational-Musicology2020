MY RESEARCH

First of all I want to research about renomed Choirs. Through Europe there are different good Choirs, I dont know yet which choirs I would like to include.

Choirs possible: The sixteen (England) Capella Amsterdam (Netherlands) Vox Luminis (Estonia) Monteverdi Choir (England) Nederlandse Bachvereniging (Netherlands) Rias Kammerchor (Germany) Collegium Vocale (Belgium)

I would like to take the Mass in B-minor of J.S. Bach, and compare the performances/recordings of these choirs and in what they differ. Since the whole mass is rather a lot of work, I should proably focus on some of the parts of the mass. Depending on how much time things take I can make an analysis of as many parts as I wish. The only problem at this point is, Renomed Choirs are mainly find in Europe. So I could focus mainly on Europe. But is this good enough?

All this choirs are listed in Spotify with the Mass in B-minor - J.S. Bach

At this point my hypothesis is, that there are many different recordings, so the outcome will be different. The next question through this would be why these data differ? But it will be probably then more for a historical research. Another question I would have, is some of the choirs made more then just one recording, is it eligible to include these data? Some of the choirsrecordings are not on spotify, is it possible still, to get those data? For example: Nederlandse Bachvereniging. I just find their recording in Youtube.

The data I need are:

The recordings of the Choirs, (spotify) From here I can make different playlists ( every playlist is a part of the mass )
